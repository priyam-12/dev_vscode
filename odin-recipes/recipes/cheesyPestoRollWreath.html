    <img src="pesto-roll.jpg" alt="Cheesy-Pesto-Roll-Wreath ">
    <p>This savory appetizer is great to eat as a bite on its own or spread onto crackers. You can add fresh rosemary sprigs and cherry tomatoes to make the wreath even more festive.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Â½ cup basil pesto, divided</li>
        <li>12 sprigs fresh rosemary, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw a 5-inch circle on the center of the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Open both cans of dough and separate crescents into 16 triangles. Arrange the triangles on the prepared baking sheet the flat edges lined up and overlapping along the 5-inch circle and the points facing outward; it will resemble a sunburst.</li>
        <li>Combine cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, and 6 tablespoons pesto in a bowl. Mix until well combined, then spread around the center of the ring of crescent dough.</li>
        <li>Wrap each dough triangle up over filling and tucking it under the bottom to secure. Repeat around the entire ring. Brush remaining 2 tablespoons pesto on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the dough is golden brown and cooked, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice into individually portioned rings, but keep all the rings in place in the shape of a wreath. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and cherry tomatoes.</li>
    </ol>
